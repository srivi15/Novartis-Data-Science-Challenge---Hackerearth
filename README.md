# Novartis-Data-Science-Challenge---Hackerearth
This repository is related to the task I did for Novartis Data Science Hiring Challenge conducted in HackerRank.

The Novartis Data Science Hiring Challenge is conducted through HackerEarth platform. The task is to predict whether the server will be hacked given the dataset with anonymous values.

The dataset provided is cleaned, explored, preprocessed and then sent to proceed with the model development, model fitting and predictions. The ensemble model I developed here has produced highest accuracy rate of 98.63%.
